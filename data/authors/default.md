Hi there, my name is Matt! Welcome to my website. I'm an full stack software engineer with a strong background in SaaS product engineering, and full stack web development.

I'm a passionate learner, so here you will find all of my documentation and notes that pertain to my current interests!

(Be prepared for tons of dotfiles because I love tinkering with my daily workflow. Arch Linux, Neovim, Window managers, etc.)
